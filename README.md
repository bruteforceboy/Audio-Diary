# Audio-Diary
Audio Diary is a software that enables users to keep daily voice notes/audio recordings of daily observations or events.
It is a diary but this time allows users to record audio and saves them the stress of writing. 

I built Audio Diary for my project work at NIIT (National Institute Of Technology), Nigeria.
